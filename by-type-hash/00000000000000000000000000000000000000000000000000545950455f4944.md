# TYPE\_ID System Script Error Codes

This is the built-in `TYPE_ID` system script, which must be referenced by type hash. The code hash is just "TYPE_ID" in hex encoded by ASCII. The script is not executed by VM, and the source code in the CKB Rust implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/develop/script/src/type_id.rs).

## -1

`ERROR_ARGS`

`TYPE_ID` script should only accept one argument, which is the hash of all inputs when creating the cell.


## -2

`ERROR_TOO_MANY_CELLS`

There could be at most one input cell and one output cell with current `TYPE_ID` script group.

## -3

`ERROR_INVALID_INPUT_HASH`

If there's only one output cell with current `TYPE_ID` script group and no input cell, we are creating such a cell. We also need to validate that the first argument matches the hash of following items concatenated:

1. First CellInput of the transaction.
2. Index of the first output cell in current script group.

The the hash does not match, the verification fails with error `ERROR_INVALID_INPUT_HASH (-3)`.
